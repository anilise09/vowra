# Project Ember

Project Ember is the working codename for an 18+ cross-platform dating app for Android and iPhone. Matching, messaging, blocking, reporting, and match-gated voice/video calling belong to the free core.

The launch name is intentionally undecided until trademark, domain, and store-name checks are complete.

## Status

CP-041 is in progress and committed locally: match creation and updates now go through a small in-memory repository/service layer instead of direct app-state mutation, while preserving mutual-like free messaging, call readiness, report, block, and unmatch behavior. `flutter analyze` passed and `flutter test` passed with 29 tests. The Android debug APK build was attempted twice but stalled during Gradle assemble, so APK build evidence is pending for this checkpoint. ASUS/device testing was skipped as requested. Portrait generation remains paused until coding and UI design are further along. The original 50-women/50-men target is complete, and the Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, and Mexican expansion targets are complete. Overall representation-expansion progress is 160 / 220. Explicit fixture background metadata is shown in discovery. See `docs/PROTOTYPE_PROFILE_DATASET.md` for exact counts, plus `CHECKPOINTS.md`, `docs/COMPETITIVE_RESEARCH.md`, `docs/PRODUCT_PLAN.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/SECURITY_AND_SAFETY.md`.

## Intended stack

- Flutter/Dart mobile client (Android and iOS)
- TypeScript backend with PostgreSQL and PostGIS
- Signed media uploads with asynchronous moderation
- Managed WebRTC provider for the MVP
- StoreKit 2 and Google Play Billing

No production service, billing integration, or real user-data collection exists yet.
