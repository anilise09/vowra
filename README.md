# Project Ember

Project Ember is the working codename for an 18+ cross-platform dating app for Android and iPhone. Matching, messaging, blocking, reporting, and match-gated voice/video calling belong to the free core.

The launch name is intentionally undecided until trademark, domain, and store-name checks are complete.

## Status

CP-017 is complete: the original 50-women/50-men target and the Indian expansion target are complete. The Pakistani expansion is at 5 women and 5 men, bringing overall representation-expansion progress to 30 / 220. Explicit fixture background metadata is shown in discovery. See `docs/PROTOTYPE_PROFILE_DATASET.md` for exact counts, plus `CHECKPOINTS.md`, `docs/COMPETITIVE_RESEARCH.md`, `docs/PRODUCT_PLAN.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/SECURITY_AND_SAFETY.md`.

## Intended stack

- Flutter/Dart mobile client (Android and iOS)
- TypeScript backend with PostgreSQL and PostGIS
- Signed media uploads with asynchronous moderation
- Managed WebRTC provider for the MVP
- StoreKit 2 and Google Play Billing

No production service, billing integration, or real user-data collection exists yet.
