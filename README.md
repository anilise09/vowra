# Project Ember

Project Ember is the working codename for an 18+ cross-platform dating app for Android and iPhone. Matching, messaging, blocking, reporting, and match-gated voice/video calling belong to the free core.

The launch name is intentionally undecided until trademark, domain, and store-name checks are complete.

## Status

CP-045 is complete locally: the first backend-facing account/profile contract now uses authenticated `/me` operations and structurally excludes client-authoritative age, coordinates, account ID, verification, entitlement, and match claims. The unconfigured API fails closed and no network provider or real-user collection exists. `flutter analyze` passed, all 40 tests passed, and the Android debug APK built. No device walkthrough was performed for this checkpoint. Portrait generation remains paused until coding and UI design are further along. The original 50-women/50-men target is complete, and the Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, and Mexican expansion targets are complete. Overall representation-expansion progress is 160 / 220. Explicit fixture background metadata is shown in discovery. See `docs/PROTOTYPE_PROFILE_DATASET.md` for exact counts, plus `docs/BACKEND_API_CONTRACT.md`, `CHECKPOINTS.md`, `docs/COMPETITIVE_RESEARCH.md`, `docs/PRODUCT_PLAN.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/SECURITY_AND_SAFETY.md`.

## Intended stack

- Flutter/Dart mobile client (Android and iOS)
- TypeScript backend with PostgreSQL and PostGIS
- Signed media uploads with asynchronous moderation
- Managed WebRTC provider for the MVP
- StoreKit 2 and Google Play Billing

No production service, billing integration, or real user-data collection exists yet.
